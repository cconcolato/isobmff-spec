# Foreword
The ISO Base Media File Format is a large standard used by a wide community. Its development process within [MPEG] (http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/) follows the ISO rules which are not always appropriate or agile-enough for such a public standard. In particular, the complexity to provide input to the standard committee reduces the chances of people to submit issues.

This repository aims at being a light-weight way of gathering comments, issues, corrigendum items from the open source/web/developer community for proper input into the ISO development process. It is not part of the official ISO process. It is not meant for people to propose new technologies. For that, please join the MPEG group as described [here](http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/content/how-join). 

This repository should facilitate editing of corrigendum items and help improve the standard, given the editing facilities of GitHub. It may be used to discuss the standard but it is not the official discussion list. For that, you may also use the official [mp4-sys mailing list](https://lists.aau.at/mailman/listinfo/mp4-sys) where it would reach a larger audience.
